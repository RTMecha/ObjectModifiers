# ObjectModifiers
Customize your gameplay with codeblock-like triggers and actions!

Triggers and Actions are Modifiers that are stored within an object extension. Triggers activate before Actions so they can act as an "if" codeblock.

Few examples for Triggers and Actions include the following:
- setPitch (Action)
- blur (Action)
- particleSystem (Action)
- playerCollide (Trigger)
- loadEquals (Trigger)
- And more!
